Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: Add support for LLVM's Polly optimizer

This adds support for compiling the kernel with optimizations offered
by LLVM's polyhedral loop optimizer known as Polly, which can improve
performance by improving cache locality in loops. Note that LLVM is not
compiled with Polly by default -- it must be enabled explicitly.

[ghostrider-reborn]
- Removed polly DCE as it's no longer supported
